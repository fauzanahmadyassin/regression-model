The dataset was downloaded from https://kaggle.com/tok991gimo/clothing-sales-data 

This project was implementing few techniques for regression problem. All mean squared error performance
from each model would be compared to seek the optimum and fittest technique for the problem. The model includes:

1. Linear Regression
2. Random Forest
3. Gradient Boosting
4. Deep Learning
